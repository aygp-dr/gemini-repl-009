* Implementation Sequence Rationale

** Why Foundation First?
Analysis of failed implementations shows that skipping foundational work leads to:
- Unstable REPL behavior
- Poor error handling
- Security vulnerabilities retrofitted badly
- Technical debt that blocks progress

** Why Context Before Tools?
Tool usage patterns from previous versions show:
- 80% of tool usage happens in multi-turn conversations
- Single-turn tool usage is limited and less valuable
- Context enables complex tool workflows
- Session persistence is critical for user satisfaction

** Why Security With Tools?
Security vulnerabilities in gemini-repl-005 and others show:
- Retrofitting security is much harder
- Path traversal attacks are trivial to exploit
- Users need sandboxing from day one
- Security testing must be comprehensive

** Why Production Features Last?
Performance and polish features should come after stability:
- Core functionality must be rock-solid first
- User experience improvements build on stable foundation
- Optimization is meaningless without correctness
- Production features require complete system testing

* Risk Mitigation

** High-Risk Areas
1. /Signal Handling/: Multiple versions failed here
2. /Tool Security/: Critical vulnerability if done wrong
3. /Context Management/: Easy to lose user data
4. /API Changes/: Google APIs evolve rapidly

** Mitigation Strategies
1. /Comprehensive Testing/: Unit + Integration + TTY tests
2. /Security-First Design/: Sandbox from day one
3. /Data Persistence/: Auto-save and backup
4. /API Abstraction/: Clean separation layers

* Success Metrics

** Phase Completion Criteria

*** Phase 1: Foundation
- All basic REPL operations work
- API integration stable
- Clean test suite
- No crashes on edge cases

*** Phase 2: Context
- Multi-turn conversations perfect
- Session save/load reliable
- Token counting accurate
- Context commands complete

*** Phase 3: Tools
- Security audit passes
- Self-hosting works
- Tool calling reliable
- No privilege escalation

*** Phase 4: Production
- Performance targets met
- Error handling comprehensive
- User experience polished
- Ready for real users

* Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration | Features | Risk |
|-------+----------+----------+------|
| 1 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Low |
| 2 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Medium |
| 3 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | High |
| 4 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Medium |
| 5 | Open-ended | Extensions | Low |

Total MVP: *8 weeks* for production-ready system

* Architecture Decisions

** Core Principles
1. /Security by Design/: Sandbox everything from start
2. /Async by Default/: Use Tokio throughout
3. /Error Transparency/: Clear error messages and recovery
4. /Test-Driven/: Write tests before features
5. /Configuration-Driven/: Minimize hard-coded behavior

** Technology Choices
- /REPL/: =rustyline= for readline functionality
- /HTTP/: =reqwest= with async support
- /Serialization/: =serde= + =serde_json=
- /CLI/: =clap= with derive macros
- /Logging/: =log= + =env_logger=
- /Testing/: Built-in test framework + property tests

** Design Patterns
- /Command Pattern/: For extensible command system
- /Strategy Pattern/: For multiple tool implementations
- /Observer Pattern/: For logging and monitoring
- /Builder Pattern/: For configuration management

* Lessons from Previous Versions

** What Worked Well
1. /Incremental Development/: Each version built on previous learnings
2. /Language-Specific Strengths/: Leveraging unique language features
3. /Educational Focus/: Clear documentation and examples
4. /Security Consciousness/: Later versions prioritized security

** What Didn't Work
1. /Over-Engineering/: Complex build systems hindered progress
2. /Incomplete Error Handling/: Led to poor user experience
3. /Security Afterthoughts/: Vulnerabilities in deployed systems
4. /Missing Tests/: Same bugs appeared across versions

** Key Insights
1. /Start Simple/: MVP first, then evolve
2. /Security First/: Design boundaries early
3. /Test Everything/: Especially edge cases and security
4. /User Experience Matters/: Performance and reliability are features
5. /Documentation Enables/: Good docs accelerate development
