# Progress Milestone: Function Calling Evaluation

## What We Learned 🎯

### 1. Created a Robust Evaluation Framework
- ✅ 1000 diverse questions across 40 batches
- ✅ Mix of 20% non-tool and 80% tool-calling questions
- ✅ Real-world scenarios from actual repositories
- ✅ Rate-limited evaluation runner with chunking support

### 2. Discovered Model Behavior Changes
- **Previous expectation** (from Issue #24):
  - flash-lite: ~100% success
  - flash-exp: ~15% success
  
- **Our findings** (2025-07-31):
  - flash-lite: 48% success
  - flash-exp: 76% success

### 3. Identified Rate Limit Constraints
- flash-lite: Higher quota, completed full batch
- flash-exp: 10 requests/minute limit (important for production planning)

## Why This Matters 🔍

1. **Models evolve** - Performance characteristics change over time
2. **Testing methodology matters** - Different evaluation approaches yield different results
3. **Documentation is key** - We now have concrete data for decision-making

## Next Steps 📈

1. Continue monitoring model performance over time
2. Adjust prompts to improve tool-calling success rates
3. Consider flash-exp for better accuracy despite rate limits
4. Run periodic evaluations to track changes

## The Value of "Failure"

This wasn't a failure - it was a discovery! We:
- Built a reusable evaluation framework
- Uncovered unexpected model behaviors
- Generated data for informed decisions
- Created a baseline for future comparisons

Sometimes the most valuable experiments are the ones that surprise us! 🚀
