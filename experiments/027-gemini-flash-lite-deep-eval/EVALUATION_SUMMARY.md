# Evaluation Summary

## Key Findings

### Model Performance (with System Instruction)

1. **gemini-2.0-flash-exp**: 
   - **100% success rate** on first 11 questions (11/11)
   - Hit rate limit (10 req/min) after q11
   - Overall: 17/25 (68%) including rate limit failures

2. **gemini-2.0-flash-lite**:
   - **48% success rate** (12/25)
   - No rate limiting issues
   - Inconsistent function calling behavior

### Critical Discoveries

1. **System Instruction is Essential**
   - Without: Models generate Python code instead of function calls
   - With: Proper function calling format is used

2. **flash-exp is Superior for Function Calling**
   - 100% success when not rate limited
   - Much better understanding of function calling
   - Limitation: Only 10 requests/minute

3. **flash-lite Has Function Calling Issues**
   - Only calls functions ~50% of the time when it should
   - Even with proper system instruction
   - But has higher rate limits

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
- **Use gemini-2.0-flash-exp** despite rate limits
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache responses where possible
- Consider request batching strategies

### For High-Volume Applications:
- May need to use flash-lite with workarounds
- Or implement a hybrid approach
- Monitor for model improvements

## The Experiment Success

This evaluation revealed:
1. The critical importance of system instructions
2. Significant performance differences between models
3. Rate limiting constraints that affect architecture decisions
4. The value of comprehensive testing

The "failures" taught us more than successes would have!
