# MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL Analysis

## Root Cause Identified

The MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL errors are occurring because:

1. **Model Confusion**: The model is generating Python code instead of proper function calls
2. **Response Format**: Instead of returning a `functionCall` part, it's returning `text` with code

## Example

When asked to create a file, the model responds with:
```python
print(default_api.write_file(content="print('Hello World')", path="hello.py"))
```

Instead of the expected function call format:
```json
{
  "functionCall": {
    "name": "write_file",
    "args": {
      "path": "hello.py",
      "content": "print('Hello World')"
    }
  }
}
```

## Why This Happens

1. The model seems to be treating the tools as a Python API rather than function calling
2. When it tries to generate code instead of function calls, the API can't parse it
3. This results in MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL errors

## Impact

- This is not just affecting our evaluation accuracy
- It's a fundamental misunderstanding by the model of how to use tools
- Explains why success rates are much lower than expected

## Potential Solutions

1. **System Instructions**: Add explicit instructions about function calling format
2. **Few-shot Examples**: Provide examples of correct function call usage
3. **Different Model**: Consider if flash-lite has different function calling behavior than other models
4. **API Version**: Check if we're using the correct API version for function calling
