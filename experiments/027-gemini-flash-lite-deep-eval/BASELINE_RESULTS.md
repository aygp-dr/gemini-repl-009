# Baseline Test Results

## First Run - Mock Implementation
- **Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Model**: gemini-2.0-flash-lite (mock)
- **Batch**: 001 (25 questions)
- **Results**: 6/25 successful (24.0%)
- **Note**: Using mock responses that succeed for IDs ending in 1 or 5

## Key Observations
1. Mock implementation working as expected
2. Rate limiting not applied (mock responses are instant)
3. Results saved to `results/results_batch_001_TIMESTAMP.json`
4. Framework ready for actual API integration

## Next Steps
- Implement actual Gemini API calls (Issue #25)
- Re-run baseline with real API
- Compare against expected 100% success rate from experiment 023
