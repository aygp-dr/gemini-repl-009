- `search_code`: Pattern matching and code analysis
- `write_file`: Code generation and modification

## Quality Assurance
- Consistent 80/20 tool/non-tool ratio across all batches
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced scenarios
- Comprehensive coverage of modern technology stacks
- Real-world application scenarios
- Edge cases and integration challenges

## Next Steps
This dataset is now ready for:
1. Automated evaluation runs against gemini-2.0-flash-lite
2. Function calling success rate analysis
3. Performance benchmarking across different domains
4. Comparison studies with other models
