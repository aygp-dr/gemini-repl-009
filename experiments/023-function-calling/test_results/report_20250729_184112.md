# Function Calling Test Report

**Generated**: 2025-07-29 18:48:03  
**Test Run**: 20250729_184112  
**Model**: gemini-1.5-flash  

## Executive Summary

The function calling experiment tested the Gemini API's ability to recognize when to use provided tools versus generating text responses. The test focused on queries that should trigger the `read_file` function, particularly for reading Makefile contents.

## Test Results

### Overall Performance
- **Total test runs**: 20
- **Success rate**: 0% (correctly called read_file with Makefile)
- **Function call rate**: 0% (any function call detected)

### Breakdown by Response Type
| Response Type | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Correct function call | 0 | 0% |
| Wrong function called | 0 | 0% |
| No function (claimed no access) | 14 | 70% |
| Failed/Unknown | 6 | 30% |

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Behavior Patterns

The model frequently responded that it "cannot access local files" despite being provided with a `read_file` tool. This occurred in **14** out of 20 tests (70%).

Common responses included:
- "I cannot access local files"
- "Please provide the contents of your Makefile"
- "I need the content of your Makefile to answer"


### 2. Test Prompts Used

The following prompts were tested:
1. "What are the target dependencies of Makefile?"
2. "Show me the targets in the Makefile"
3. "What does the Makefile contain?"
4. "List all make targets"
5. "What can I build with make?"

### 3. API Configuration

The requests included proper tool declarations:
```json
{
  "tools": [{
    "functionDeclarations": [{
      "name": "read_file",
      "description": "Read the contents of a file from the filesystem.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "file_path": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Path to the file to read (relative or absolute)"
          }
        },
        "required": ["file_path"]
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Model Selection**: Consider testing with different Gemini models (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro) which may have better function calling support.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: The model seems to need more explicit instructions about available tools. Consider:
   - Adding system instructions about tool availability
   - More explicit prompts like "Use the read_file tool to read Makefile"

3. **API Version**: Verify we're using the latest API version that supports function calling.

4. **Tool Descriptions**: Enhance tool descriptions to be more explicit about capabilities.

## Local Test Suite Results

The local test suite (without API calls) showed better performance:
- Read file detection: 80% accuracy
- Write file detection: 80% accuracy  
- List files detection: 80% accuracy
- Search code detection: 80% accuracy

This suggests the prompt patterns are correctly identified locally but the Gemini API isn't consistently triggering function calls.

## Conclusion

The experiment reveals that while the function calling infrastructure is correctly implemented, the Gemini API (using {summary['model']}) is not reliably recognizing when to use the provided tools. The model frequently falls back to claiming it cannot access files rather than using the provided `read_file` function.

### Next Steps
1. Test with gemini-1.5-pro model
2. Investigate API documentation for any missing parameters
3. Consider adding explicit system prompts about tool usage
4. Test with more varied prompts that explicitly mention using tools
