# Experiment 019: Phase 1 Progress Tracking

## Purpose
Track remaining Phase 1 work and create experiments for incomplete tasks.

## Current Status (from PHASE-1-2-PLAN.org)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:
- **1.1 Project Setup**: Basic project structure, CI, logging ‚úì
- **1.2 Core REPL Loop**: Basic readline, signal handling ‚úì  
- **1.3 Command System**: Base commands (/help, /exit) ‚úì
- **1.4 API Client**: HTTP client, Gemini API integration ‚úì

### üîß Partially Complete:
- **API Integration**: Basic connection works, but needs streaming response handling
- **Signal Handling**: Basic SIGINT works, need SIGTERM and comprehensive testing
- **Token Management**: Not started (was Phase 2 task but needed for production)
- **Request/Response Logging**: Infrastructure exists but not integrated into main client

### üìã Missing Phase 1 Work:

#### High Priority:
1. **Streaming Response Handling**: 
   - Current client uses blocking requests
   - Need real-time response streaming from Gemini API
   - Related: experiments/010-api-integration

2. **ApiLogger Integration**:
   - ApiLogger struct exists but unused (shows warnings)
   - Need to integrate into GeminiClient for request/response capture
   - Required for mock server development

3. **Production Mode Detection**:
   - Currently always uses NOOP_MODE=true for integration tests
   - Need proper environment detection and mode switching
   - Related: RFC-001-CLI-FLAGS.md

#### Medium Priority:
4. **Enhanced Signal Handling**:
   - Add SIGTERM handler for graceful shutdown
   - Test signal handling under load
   - Proper cleanup of resources

5. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Better API error messages
   - Network timeout handling
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Low Priority:
6. **Multi-line Input Detection**:
   - Current REPL handles single-line only
   - Need better prompt handling for continued input

## Experiments Needed

### Experiment 020: Streaming Response Integration
**Purpose**: Integrate streaming API responses into main REPL
**Files**: Update src/api.rs and src/main.rs
**Success**: REPL shows real-time streaming responses from Gemini

### Experiment 021: ApiLogger Integration  
**Purpose**: Connect ApiLogger to GeminiClient for request logging
**Files**: Update src/api.rs to use logging::ApiLogger
**Success**: JSONL files created in logs/ directory during API calls

### Experiment 022: Production Mode Environment Detection
**Purpose**: Implement proper mode detection (noop/mock/production)
**Files**: Create src/config.rs, update src/main.rs
**Success**: REPL respects environment variables for mode selection

### Experiment 023: Enhanced Signal Handling
**Purpose**: Comprehensive signal handling with resource cleanup
**Files**: Update signal handling in src/main.rs
**Success**: All signals handled gracefully with proper cleanup

## Phase 1 Completion Criteria

From PHASE-1-2-PLAN.org:
- [x] REPL starts and accepts input ‚úì
- [x] Commands execute without panic ‚úì  
- [x] API connection established ‚úì
- [ ] **Real-time streaming responses** ‚Üê Missing
- [ ] **Request/response logging active** ‚Üê Missing
- [ ] **Production mode detection** ‚Üê Missing
- [x] Graceful shutdown on SIGINT ‚úì
- [ ] **Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM** ‚Üê Missing

## Next Actions

1. Create experiment 020 for streaming responses
2. Create experiment 021 for ApiLogger integration
3. Create experiment 022 for mode detection
4. Run comprehensive integration tests
5. Update main REPL with experimental findings
6. Verify all Phase 1 completion criteria met

## Dependencies for Phase 2

Phase 2 requires:
- Stable API streaming (experiment 020)
- Working request logging (experiment 021) 
- Proper mode detection (experiment 022)
- All Phase 1 criteria met

Without these, Phase 2 context management will be built on unstable foundation.
