Context and Details for Environment Configuration

BACKGROUND:
User pointed out original .env.example had many more configuration options. Also requested testing of HTTP proxy on port 3129 for potential API request routing.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Updated .env.example with all original config sections:
   - API, REPL, Logging, Tools, Rate Limiting configurations
   - Added proxy configuration section
   - Restored all secondary features from original design
2. Created GH_SECRETS.md documenting GitHub CLI commands
3. Created experiment 001-http-proxy-testing:
   - Tests proxy connectivity on port 3129
   - Confirms HTTPS tunneling works
   - Provides Rust integration example
   - Makefile for easy testing

TESTING:
- Verified .env remains gitignored
- Proxy test shows port 3129 active and working
- HTTPS requests successfully tunnel through proxy
- Gemini API endpoint reachable (returns 404 without auth)

EXPERIMENTS:
- 001-http-proxy-testing: Confirmed local proxy can route API requests

DEVIATIONS:
- Added proxy configuration not in original plan
- More comprehensive env vars than initially planned

FOLLOW-UP:
- Integrate proxy support into Rust client
- User will provide real GEMINI_API_KEY when ready
- Implement configuration loading in main app
