Context and Details for Test Infrastructure

BACKGROUND:
User requested expect script to test REPL event loop with mock Gemini endpoint for '2 + 40' calculation. Created comprehensive test structure for both integration and unit tests.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created tests/integration/ directory with expect scripts:
   - test_basic.exp: Simple noop mode verification
   - test_repl.exp: Comprehensive REPL functionality test
2. Created tests/unit/ directory with placeholder for Rust unit tests
3. Tests verify:
   - REPL starts and accepts input
   - Noop mode echoes correctly
   - Commands (/help, /exit) work
   - Clean shutdown

TESTING:
- Ran test_basic.exp successfully
- Verified '2 + 40' query echoes in noop mode
- Confirmed /exit cleanly shuts down REPL

EXPERIMENTS:
- Tried Ctrl-C handling in expect but terminal escape sequences made it complex
- Simplified to basic functionality tests

DEVIATIONS:
- Did not implement mock Gemini service endpoint yet (Phase 2)
- Currently tests noop mode only

FOLLOW-UP:
- Add mock HTTP server for API testing in Phase 2
- Expand unit tests as modules are built
- Add CI integration for automated testing
