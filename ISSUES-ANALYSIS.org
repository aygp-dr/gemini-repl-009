* Critical Issues to Address

** 1. Security Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]

*** Path Traversal (gemini-repl-005#21) - FIXED
- Tools allowed access to any file on system
- No path validation or sandboxing
- Solution: Strict path validation, sandbox to workspace

*** API Key Exposure (gemini-repl#55)
- API keys logged in debug mode
- Keys visible in error messages
- Solution: Scrub keys from all outputs

*** Code Execution (gemini-repl-005#25) - FIXED
- Unsafe Python execution in tools
- Solution: Removed execute_python tool

** 2. Core Functionality Issues [HIGH]

*** Signal Handling (gemini-repl#12, gemini-repl-001#5, gemini-repl-003#19)
- REPL becomes unresponsive to Ctrl+C
- No clean exit on Ctrl+D
- Hangs when stdin not connected properly

*** Context Loss (gemini-repl#47, gemini-repl-005#19)
- Each prompt sent in isolation
- No conversation history maintained
- Context not preserved between messages

*** Tool Recognition (gemini-repl-005#26, #35)
- AI refuses to use available tools
- Claims "no file system access"
- Inconsistent tool dispatch

** 3. Performance Issues [MEDIUM]

*** Slow Response Times (gemini-repl-007#15)
- 30+ second delays reported
- No streaming responses
- No progress indicators

*** Memory Usage (gemini-repl-006#22)
- Long conversations consume excessive memory
- No context pruning
- No summarization

*** Startup Performance (gemini-repl-005#30)
- Slow cold starts
- Heavy dependencies

* Key Feature Requests

** 1. Session Management [HIGH]
- Named sessions (gemini-repl-006#24)
- Session resume (gemini-repl-005#15)
- Session branching/merging
- Export to markdown

** 2. Tool System Enhancements [HIGH]
- Minimal tool set (4-6 tools cover 80% use cases)
- Better tool descriptions
- Tool usage examples
- Conditional dispatch

** 3. UI/UX Improvements [MEDIUM]
- Status line (gemini-repl#41)
- Progress indicators
- Response formatting
- Syntax highlighting
- ASCII art banner

** 4. Developer Experience [MEDIUM]
- Live reload (gemini-repl#29)
- Debug mode
- Performance monitoring
- Log analysis tools

* Patterns and Insights

** Tool Usage Statistics (from gemini-repl-008#44)
Based on Claude Code usage analysis:
- 53% - Command execution (bash)
- 11% - File editing
- 11% - File reading
- 6% - File searching
- 5% - Directory listing

** Minimal Tool Set (from gemini-repl-007#41)
4 tools cover 40-50% of use cases:
1. read_file
2. write_file
3. list_files
4. search_files

Adding 2 more covers 80-85%:
5. run_command
6. edit_file

** Common User Complaints
1. "REPL won't respond to Ctrl+C"
2. "AI won't use the tools"
3. "Lost my conversation context"
4. "Takes forever to respond"
5. "Can't resume my session"

* Experimental Features

** Observer Pattern (gemini-repl-005, -006, -007)
- Named observer sessions
- Builder/observer commands
- Experiment tracking
- Self-reflection capabilities

** Self-Hosting (multiple repos)
- REPL can modify its own code
- Tool calling for self-improvement
- Memetic lineage tracking

** Formal Methods (gemini-repl-001)
- TLA+ specifications
- Alloy models
- Formal verification

* Implementation Priorities for Rust Version

** Phase 1: Security & Core [CRITICAL]
1. Implement secure path validation
2. API key protection
3. Robust signal handling
4. Basic context management
5. Minimal tool set (4 tools)

** Phase 2: Performance & UX [HIGH]
1. Streaming responses
2. Session persistence
3. Progress indicators
4. Memory management
5. Error recovery

** Phase 3: Advanced Features [MEDIUM]
1. Full tool suite (6 tools)
2. Status line
3. Configuration profiles
4. Cross-platform support
5. Debug tooling

** Phase 4: Experimental [LOW]
1. Observer pattern
2. Self-hosting capabilities
3. Formal verification
4. Advanced UI themes

* Lessons Learned

1. **Security is Critical**: Multiple versions had severe vulnerabilities
2. **Simple Tools Win**: 4-6 tools handle most use cases
3. **Context is Essential**: Users hate losing conversation history
4. **Performance Matters**: >500ms delays frustrate users
5. **Signal Handling is Hard**: Multiple versions got it wrong
6. **Tool Dispatch is Tricky**: AI needs clear guidance
7. **Testing Prevents Regression**: Same bugs appeared across versions

* Recommendations for gemini-repl-009

1. Start with security-first design
2. Implement only the minimal tool set initially
3. Focus on core REPL reliability
4. Add comprehensive tests from day one
5. Document tool usage clearly
6. Implement proper signal handling
7. Keep dependencies minimal
8. Design for performance
9. Plan for session management early
10. Learn from all previous versions
