Context and Details for Makefile Fixes

BACKGROUND:
User tested live API key but Rust experiments failed to load environment variables. FreeBSD uses sh instead of bash, so 'source' command was not available.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Fixed experiments/004-rust-api-client/Makefile:
   - Changed 'source ../../.env' to '. ../../.env' for sh compatibility
   - Now properly loads API key from .env file

2. Fixed experiments/010-api-integration/Makefile:
   - Same sh compatibility fix
   - Ensures API key is available for integration tests

3. Added push-all target to main Makefile:
   - User requested 'gmake push-all' functionality
   - Simple wrapper for 'git push origin HEAD'

TESTING:
- Both Rust experiments now successfully use live API key
- Experiment 004: Returns '42' with 200 OK status
- Experiment 010: All 3 test cases pass (math, quantum, hello world)

DEVIATIONS:
None - minimal changes for compatibility

FOLLOW-UP:
Ready to push all Phase 1 work to GitHub
