Context and Details for GitHub Actions Setup

BACKGROUND:
User successfully added GEMINI_API_KEY to GitHub secrets and requested experiment to track workflow status. Created comprehensive CI/CD setup.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created experiment 002-github-actions with:
   - Makefile for checking workflow status
   - Status check script
   - CI workflow template
   - Documentation of secret addition
2. Added .github/workflows/ci.yml with:
   - Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, macOS)
   - Multi-Rust version (stable, beta)
   - Security auditing
   - Integration testing with expect
   - Proper secret usage

TESTING:
- Verified GEMINI_API_KEY exists in repository secrets
- Confirmed gmake -C experiments/002-github-actions run works
- Workflow ready to run on next push

EXPERIMENTS:
- 002-github-actions: Tracks CI/CD status and provides tooling

DEVIATIONS:
- Added security audit job (not in original plan)
- More comprehensive matrix testing than minimal setup

FOLLOW-UP:
- Workflow will trigger on push to GitHub
