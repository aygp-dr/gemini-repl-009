Context and Details for Gitignore Update

BACKGROUND:
User requested not to remove crates/ directory when I was cleaning up the workspace structure. The directory contains planned multi-crate architecture for Phase 2.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added /crates/ to .gitignore to exclude from version control
2. Preserves directory structure for future use without cluttering commits

TESTING:
- Verified crates/ directory no longer shows in git status
- Confirmed existing crate structure remains on disk

EXPERIMENTS:
- Workspace structure (gemini-core, gemini-cli, gemini-api, gemini-tools) created but not used in Phase 1

DEVIATIONS:
- Originally planned to use workspace immediately, but simplified to single crate for rapid Phase 1 delivery

FOLLOW-UP:
- Will un-ignore and properly implement workspace structure in Phase 2
- Crate separation will improve modularity and testing
