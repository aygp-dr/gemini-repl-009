Context and Details for Phase 1 REPL Implementation

BACKGROUND:
User running 'gmake run' in parallel shell, needed quick noop REPL to verify basic functionality. This implements the minimum viable REPL meeting Phase 1 requirements from IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.org.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created src/main.rs with complete noop REPL featuring:
   - Rustyline integration for readline with history
   - Proper signal handling (Ctrl+C continues, Ctrl+D exits)
   - Command prefix detection (/) for REPL commands
   - Basic commands: /help, /exit, /quit, /model, /clear
   - CLI args with clap (--api-key, --model, --debug)
   - Structured logging with tracing
   - Clear feedback when no API key provided

TESTING:
- REPL compiles and runs with 'gmake run'
- Signal handling tested: Ctrl+C properly caught and continues
- Command parsing works for all implemented commands
- History persistence between inputs confirmed
- Graceful shutdown on /exit and Ctrl+D

EXPERIMENTS:
- Considered using crossterm for terminal handling but rustyline provides sufficient functionality for Phase 1
- Evaluated async REPL loop but synchronous is simpler for noop phase

DEVIATIONS:
- Added /clear command (not in original spec) for better UX
- More detailed help than planned, includes signal handling info
- Added version display in welcome message for debugging

FOLLOW-UP:
- Ready for GEMINI_API_KEY when user provides it
- Next: Add actual API integration in Phase 2
- Will need to implement streaming responses with tokio
- Security sandbox for file operations pending
