Context and Details for Frequency Analysis Tools

BACKGROUND:
User requested frequency analysis tools based on a letter frequency example,
specifically wanting to analyze top committers and create formal specs.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Created scripts/freq-analysis/top-committers.sh - Shows top K committers
2. Created scripts/freq-analysis/freq-analyze.sh - Generic frequency tool
3. Created scripts/freq-analysis/letter-freq.sh - Letter frequency (example)
4. Created specs/FrequencyAnalysis.tla - TLA+ formal specification
5. Created specs/FrequencyAnalysis.als - Alloy formal specification

TESTING:
- Tested top-committers.sh - correctly shows Aidan Pace at 100%
- Scripts are composable and follow Unix philosophy
- Formal specs define invariants, guards, and composability

EXPERIMENTS:
None - direct implementation of requirements

DEVIATIONS:
- Added generic freq-analyze.sh for flexibility
- Created both TLA+ and Alloy specs for completeness

FOLLOW-UP:
- Could add Lean4 specification as mentioned
- Consider adding more statistical analysis features
- Test with larger datasets for performance
